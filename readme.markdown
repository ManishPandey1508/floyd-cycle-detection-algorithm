Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm
-------------------------------

Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm, also called the "tortoise and the
hare" algorithm, is a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers,
which move through the sequence at different speeds. 

I implemented a subset of the linked list abstract data type, I could
have use the java.util.LinkedList, but I prefer it to be not dependent
from other classes. 

I created test for both, the LinkedList and the algorithm.
